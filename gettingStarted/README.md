# Getting Started

### We need to create a folder

 - Let's create a folder, It is very simple
 
```sh
$ mkdir webpackdemo
```
- Navigate to this folder

```sh
$ cd webpackdemo
```

- We can create 'package.json' file. This needs very simple command

```sh
$ npm init -y
```
You will get new file which name is 'package.json'.

```sh
{
  "name": "gettingStarted",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "### We need to create a folder",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```
#### Installing webpack node module is the next step

We need simple command as shown below 

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev web-pack

```

### Folder and file creation

- index.html
- /src/index.js
